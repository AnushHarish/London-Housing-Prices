# London-Housing-Prices

## Objective

The question is, how much are people willing to pay, and how important is this aspect of distance to the nearest school in estimating housing prices when compared to more traditional variables? 

## Tools Used

Jupyter Notebook - Python

## Methodology

This project uses hedonic analysis of various house characteristics like area, the number of rooms, type of houses, and the neighbourhood characteristics like distance to the city center, distance to the nearest transit station, distance to the nearest school, and distance to roads to analyse the impact on London housing prices. More importantly, it answers whether the distance to the nearest school impacts house prices.

## Conclusion

This study contributes to the existing literature by stressing the importance of considering the distance from a house to school and school quality when households and policymakers value a house. These results have some straightforward policy implications. Since the homeowner’s value is closer to schooling, care should be taken in the placement of schools. Boundaries should be drawn to minimize the overall Distance to homes within the school district. Several recent studies have focused on the quality of schools to address the price variations in houses across London. This paper opens up to possibilities of exploring questions around how the prices might vary with the interaction between the Distance to school parameter and the quality of school parameter. This paper might also enable researchers to consider various non-linear models to fit the parameters discussed. There could also be merit in splitting the schools into Primary, Secondary and high school categories to analyse the impact of prices. It might also be worth exploring ranges of Distance to the nearest school to better understand its impact on London house prices. Also, further research is needed to consider what features of a school make a “good school” (at least to parents).
