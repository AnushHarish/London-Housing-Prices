# London-Housing-Prices

## Objective
The question is, how much are people willing to pay, and how important is this aspect of distance to the nearest school in estimating housing prices when compared to more traditional variables? This paper uses hedonic analysis of various house characteristics like area, the number of rooms, type of houses, and the neighbourhood characteristics like distance to the city center, distance to the nearest transit station, distance to the nearest school, and distance to roads to analyse the impact on London housing prices. More importantly, it answers whether the distance to the nearest school impacts house prices.
